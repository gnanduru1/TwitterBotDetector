# Twitter Bot Detector Using Graph-Based Machine Learning Algorithms

### Collaborators
- Ganesh Nanduru (bae9wk@virginia.edu)
- Mateen Afshari (ma8dc@virginia.edu)
- Aryan Magoon (am9rf@virginia.edu)

### Dataset
We use TwiBot-22 as our dataset of tweets and users to train and evaluate graph-based models for bot detection. Before running the code you must download TwiBot-22 from a Google Drive link from the developer's [GitHub repo](https://github.com/LuoUndergradXJTU/TwiBot-22). You must request permission to view the dataset from the developer - in your request please note the university / company you are associated with and your use case.

## Code

This repo contains three notebooks to be run in this order:
1. [Preprocessing](preprocessing.ipynb)
2. [Graph creation](create_graph.ipynb)
3. [Model training](train_models.ipynb)
